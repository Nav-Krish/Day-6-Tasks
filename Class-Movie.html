        //The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

        //title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
        //studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
        //rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

//a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

          class Movie{
            constructor(title,studio,rating){
                this.title=title
                this.studio=studio
                this.rating=rating
            }
          }
          var m1=new Movie("Deadpool","Fox Studios","R")
          console.log(m1)

//b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

          class Movie{
            constructor(title,studio,rating="PG"){
                this.title=title
                this.studio=studio
                this.rating=rating
            }
          }
          let m1=new Movie("The Lion king","Walt Disney Pictures")
          console.log(m1)

//c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

          class Movie{
            constructor(title,studio,rating){
                this.title=title
                this.studio=studio
                this.rating=rating
            }
            getPG(arr){
                let PG=[]
                for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
                    if(arr[i].rating=="PG"){
                        PG.push(arr[i].title)
                    }
                }
                console.log("PG movies are ", PG)
            }
          }
          let m1=new Movie("Deadpool","Fox studios","R")
          let m2=new Movie("The Lion king","Walt Disney Pictures","PG")
          let m3=new Movie("Lord Of The Rings", "New Line Cinema","PG")
          let m4=new Movie("Mission Impossible","Skydance Media","PG13")
          let m5=new Movie("Finding Nemo","Walt Disney Pictures","PG")
        
          let m=[m1,m2,m3,m4,m5]
          console.log(m)

          m1.getPG(m)


//d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

          class Movie{
            constructor(title,studio,rating){
                this.title=title
                this.studio=studio
                this.rating=rating
            }
          }
          let m1=new Movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG13")
          console.log(m1)
